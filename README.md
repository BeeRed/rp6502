# Rumbledethumps' Picocomputer 6502

The Picocomputer explores retro computing and game development by removing the barrier between genuine 8-bit hardware and modern devices. It can be built entirely with through-hole components, compactly using surface mount devices, or even on a breadboard. No programming devices need to be purchased and the only component used that wasn't available in the 1980s is the $4/â‚¬4 Raspberry Pi Pico.

This is the reference design. It is a 6502 with 64K of SRAM and an optional 6522. A pair of Raspberry Pi Picos are used for power, clocking, video, audio, WiFi, and USB. It is programmed over USB. A filesystem is planned so it can be programmed with a USB flash drive.

## Project Status

Hardware is tested. Schematic for the reference design is unlikely to change.

Graphics Mode 0, aka Color ANSI Terminal, is working. USB keyboard works. EhBASIC works.

Addressable-memory graphics modes are not yet implemented.

Sound is not yet implemented.

Filesystem is not yet implemented.

## Hardware Notes

The PIX port will likely be "jumpered" into a high-speed graphics bus. However, work on this hasn't started so I left these pins exposed in case someone comes up with a better use for it.

The Pico VGA is optional. Something to control the RIA over the UART Tx/Rx lines is still required. You might, for example, be developing a video system based on other hardware and prefer to have your video chip control the RIA.

The 6522 is optional. You may need to pull-up IRQB/VIRQ if you omit this from the reference design. The GPIOs are not used for anything, but some software may not function without timers.

## Dev Setup

This is only for developing the Pi Pico software. For writing 6502 software, see the examples.

Standard Raspberry Pi Pico C SDK setup per the official docs; set PICO_SDK_PATH and PICO_EXTRAS_PATH, use cmake. The VSCode launch settings connect to a remote debug session. For example, I use a Picoprobe under WSL by passing the device to Linux with usbipd-win then bringing up a couple of terminals for the debugger and monitor.

The Pi Pico VGA is also a Picoprobe for development and terminal use. Load a release build of rp6502_vga.uf2 on it with the BOOT SEL button. You can do the UF2 process with the RIA board too, or use the VGA/Picoprobe board to load it using OpenOCD.
